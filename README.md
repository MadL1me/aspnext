ASP.NET 8 Opinionated template for fast development. **_Write code, not Configs._**

## Where to start

Currently, main repository contains `Aspnext.Template` template - template with ASP.NET Core, Zitadel and many other things.

Each _Template_ is easy runs in docker, have its own _README_ which contains info about project Stack, documentation and useful commands list.

If you don't want to use it, you can start with __main__ template like this:

1. Install template:

```sh
dotnet new install Aspnext.Template::8.1.0
```

2. Create template with dotnet new:

```sh
dotnet new aspnext -o "MyAwesomeProjectName"
```

3. Use your template! (For example, go to Aspnext.Template template [README](https://github.com/MadL1me/aspnet-awesome-templates/blob/master/Asp.AwesomeTemplates.Spa/Template/README.md), it will have all required commands with your configuration)
